Sends raw image data from a hopefully 1-bit (monochrome) PCX image to a listening UDP port. Intent is to set contents of an 8x5 minecraft jumbotron.

Usage:

python setimage.py [pcx file] [host] [port]

A sample image and its inverse (image.pcx, imageinverted.pcs) is provided along with images to reset the screen (reset.pcx) and set all pixels (set.pcs).
